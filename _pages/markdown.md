Principal Investigator

I am broadly interested in high-performance motor drive, power electronics, electric machines, and distributed energy resources. I was a postdoc with the Wisconsin Electric Machines and Power Electronics Consortium (WEMPEC), University of Wisconsin-Madison from 2019 to 2020. Before that, I spent 6 years at UW-Madison for both M.S. and Ph.D. degrees both in electrical engineering. In 2020, I joined Michigan State University as an assistant professor.
