Our research lab focuses on transportation electrification and energy-efficient power conversion system with ultra and/or wide bandgap (UWBG/WBG) devices

Specific research interests include:
 - UWBG/WBG-based power electronics and motor drive
 - Multiphase electric machines and motor drives
 - Fault-tolerant operation with open- and short-circuit failures
 - High-speed motor drives
 - Integrated motor drives (IMDs)

Site-wide configuration
------
The main configuration file for the site is in the base directory in [_config.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_config.yml), which defines the content in the sidebars and other site-wide features. You will need to replace the default variables with ones about yourself and your site's github repository. The configuration file for the top menu is in [_data/navigation.yml](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io/blob/master/_data/navigation.yml). For example, if you don't have a portfolio or blog posts, you can remove those items from that navigation.yml file to remove them from the header.
